# Auto-DB
Welcome to Auto-DB — an automated PostgreSQL database deployment on AWS using Terraform and Ansible! With Auto-DB, you can spin up a fully configured PostgreSQL database on the cloud in no time.

## 🚀 What is Auto-DB?
Auto-DB automates the creation of AWS infrastructure and the installation and configuration of PostgreSQL. It leverages:

- Terraform to set up AWS resources, including VPCs, subnets, security groups, EC2 instances, and Elastic IPs.
- Ansible to install PostgreSQL, configure it to accept remote connections, and create an initial database.


## 🛠️ Project Structure
The project contains the following directories and files:
- **/infrastructure/**: Contains Terraform files that build AWS infrastructure.
    - `networking.tf`: Creates VPC, subnet, internet gateway, route table, and security group.
    - `servers.tf`: Launches an EC2 instance to host the PostgreSQL database.
    - `eip_addresses.tf`: Assigns a fixed Elastic IP to the database server.

- **/ansible_automation/**: Contains Ansible playbooks and configuration.
    - `ansible.cfg`: Ansible configuration file defining remote settings and inventory.
    - `server_setup.yml`: Ansible playbook to install PostgreSQL, configure remote access, and create a database.

- **/update_inventory.sh**: A shell script to automatically update the Ansible `inventory.ini` with the EC2 instance’s Elastic IP.


## 🏗️ How to Deploy
Follow these steps to deploy Auto-DB:

### Prerequisites
- Terraform, Ansible, and AWS CLI installed.
- AWS credentials configured (aws configure).
- SSH access to the EC2 instance (keypair: `Auto-DB-key-pair.pem`).

### Deployment Steps
1. **Fork the Repository**: First, fork this repository to your own GitHub account. This will allow you to modify the project if needed without affecting the original codebase.
 - Navigate to the top-right corner of this repository page and click the Fork button.

2. **Clone Your Fork**: After forking the repository, clone it to your local machine:
